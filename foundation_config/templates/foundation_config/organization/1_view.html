    <p>We just need a few more details to finish setting up your profile. We need you to do this to get started, but don't worry, you can always change these settings later. Let's get started!</p>
    <p>First, let's upload your logo. This will help you to brand and customize SME Gurus for your clients. If you don't have your logo handy, you can skip this step, but we highly recommended that you add one now.</p>
