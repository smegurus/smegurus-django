A key part of our program is to assign real world challenges to an entrepreneur. For example, \'call up someone in your industry and get them to have a cup of coffee with you\' or \'survey 5 random strangers about your product and get some feedback.\' While the majority of our clients use our Real World Challenges, your program or setting may not allow for these, so pick what best suits your organization.' %}</p>

        Real World Challenges: Your entrepreneurs will be assigned tasks where they have to interact with real people, often over the phone or face-to-face, in order to further their learning.
